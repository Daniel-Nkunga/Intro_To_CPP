# Intro_To_CPP
This is a repository containing all of my coding assignments and notes for my Intro to C++ course. This course is Missouri S&amp;T's CS_1570 instructed by Michael Gosnell and CS_1580 Ayanfeoluwa Oluyomi (TA) is just meant to serve as a collection of all my coding projects. If you're look at this to determine my coding abilities, I would advise you to look elsewhere.
